## System in Action

Here's our home page! In order to select a playlist, users can head to our 'View Playlists' page to see all their current local playlists with the option to import all their Spotify playlists as well. Users can then get song recommendations for this playlist, or choose to load a second playlist onto the screen and merge the two to produce a new playlist out of songs from the original two that have the same "vibe". We also have a drop-down menu that allows users to view their playlists based on song/album title, artist, etc.

This is our 'Search' page. Here, users can enter as much or little information they want to use in their search in the text boxes on the right. The results of their searches are displayed on the left, again with the option to sort the list of songs based on the criteria selected from the drop-down menu. Finally, users can select one or more songs to add to their playlist from this search using the 'Add' button.
